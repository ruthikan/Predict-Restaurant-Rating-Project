# Restaurant Rating Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project predicts the **Aggregate Rating** of restaurants based on various features like Cuisines, City, Price Range, Delivery Options, and Votes.  
The project was done as part of my Machine Learning Internship at **Cognizify Technologies**.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
- **Model Building**: Trained and evaluated two models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
- **Model Evaluation**: Decision Tree achieved the best RÂ² Score (~92%).
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Votes were found to be the most influential feature affecting ratings.

## Files Included 
- 'MainCode.py' - Code used to build the model
- `Restaurant_Ratings_Prediction_Report.pdf' - Project Report
- `Dataset.csv' - Dataset used

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries: 'pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
2. Load the dataset.
3. Run the script.
4. Check model performance and feature importance.

## Acknowledgment
Special thanks to **Cognizify Technologies** for the opportunity to work on this exciting project!
